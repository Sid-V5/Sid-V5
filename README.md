# Hey, I'm Sid 👋

I build software across the stack — from Win32 system hooks in Python to production SaaS apps on Vercel. Most of what I work on sits at the intersection of AI and practical tools that people actually use.

I lean heavily on AI to accelerate my workflow. Cursor, Windsurf, agentic coding — I treat these as force multipliers, not crutches. The result is I ship fast and iterate faster.

### 🌱 Propagains — Solo SaaS

**[propagains.vercel.app](https://propagains.vercel.app)** — A niche SaaS I designed, built, and shipped solo for rare plant collectors. Tracks mother plant lineage, calculates propagation ROI, and generates QR-verified genetics cards for buyers.

`Next.js` · `TypeScript` · `Supabase` · `Drizzle ORM` · `Tailwind CSS` · `Vercel`

### 🔧 Open Source Projects

**[GestureHud](https://github.com/Sid-V5/GestureHud)** — Hands-free mouse control via webcam. Real-time hand tracking with a 1-Euro filter for jitter reduction and a hysteresis state machine for gesture recognition. Injects input events at the OS level using Win32 SendInput.  
`Python` · `MediaPipe` · `OpenCV` · `Win32 API` · `ctypes`

**[UjjwalBhavishya](https://github.com/Sid-V5/UjjwalBhavishya)** — AI-powered citizen portal that matches users to government welfare schemes. Features a Gemini-powered multilingual chatbot, eligibility engine, and real-time WebSocket notifications.  
`TypeScript` · `React` · `Express` · `PostgreSQL` · `WebSocket` · `Gemini API` · `Zod`

**[EchoSynth](https://github.com/Sid-V5/EchoSynth)** — Voice synthesis and cloning API. OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint with a React frontend, Docker-ready deployment.  
`Python` · `FastAPI` · `React` · `Docker`

**[rpa_bot](https://github.com/Sid-V5/rpa_bot)** — RPA bot that extracts structured data from PDF invoices using OCR, validates fields, and generates reports. Dockerized with YAML-based config.

### 📌 Currently

- Exploring AI agent architectures (LangGraph, tool-use patterns, memory systems)
- Building productivity tools that integrate LLMs into real workflows
- Looking for internships where I can ship things that matter
