# Hey, I'm Sid 👋

CS student who likes making things that work. Mostly into AI/ML and figuring out how to turn models into actual usable tools. I also do web dev when the project needs it.

I use AI coding tools (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) pretty heavily to move fast. Treat them as part of the workflow, not a novelty.
