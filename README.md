# Hey, I'm Sid 👋

I'm a full-stack developer who builds things end-to-end — from low-level system hooks to production web apps. I like working across the stack and picking up whatever tech a project needs.

## What I'm working on

🌱 **[Propagains](https://propagains.vercel.app)** — A SaaS I built solo for rare plant collectors. Tracks lineage, calculates propagation ROI, and generates QR verification cards so buyers can verify genetics. Built with Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and deployed on Vercel.

## Projects

| Project | What it does | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [GestureHud](https://github.com/Sid-V5/GestureHud) | Hands-free mouse control using hand gestures via webcam. Real-time tracking with 1-Euro filtering and a hysteresis state machine for gesture detection. | Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Win32 API |
| [UjjwalBhavishya](https://github.com/Sid-V5/UjjwalBhavishya) | Citizen services portal with AI chatbot, scheme eligibility checking, and real-time notifications. | TypeScript, React, Express, PostgreSQL, WebSocket, Gemini API |
| [EchoSynth](https://github.com/Sid-V5/EchoSynth) | Voice synthesis API with cloning capabilities. OpenAI-compatible endpoint, Docker-ready. | Python, FastAPI, React, Docker |
| [rpa_bot](https://github.com/Sid-V5/rpa_bot) | Extracts structured data from PDF invoices using OCR, validates it, and generates CSV reports. | Python, pdfplumber, EasyOCR, Docker |

## Tech I use

**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, FastAPI  
**Data:** PostgreSQL, Prisma, NeonDB, Drizzle  
**AI/ML:** MediaPipe, OpenCV, Gemini API, EasyOCR  
**Infra:** Docker, Vercel, Git  

## Misc

- I like building things that solve real problems, even if the domain is niche
- Most of my projects start from curiosity — GestureHud came from wanting to control my PC without touching it
- Currently exploring computer vision and AI integration in practical tools
