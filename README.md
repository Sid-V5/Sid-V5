Agent orchestration. Mostly into AI/ML and figuring out how to turn models into actual usable tools, but my eye is always catching new tech. 
I learn at the speed of my curiosity if an opportunity asks for it, I'll master it.

Hobbies: • Metaphysics • Badminton • Overthinking 
| Lore: Past-life Minecraft modder & server dev.
